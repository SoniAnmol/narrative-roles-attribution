**"Narrating the Deluge: Media Framing and Public Attribution of Climate
Change in the Emilia-Romagna Floods"**  
by Tina Comes, Giulia Piccillo, Anmol Soni, and Tania Treibich.

## Overview
The study investigates how the May 2023 floods in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, influenced climate change discourse.  
It compares **media framing** and **public attribution** using narrative character roles (heroes, villains, victims) to highlight asymmetries between newspaper coverage and survey responses. Working draft is available upon request.
